# 📖 TIR
Today I Read Challenge
하루에 읽을거리를 하나씩 읽고 자신의 생각(후기)을 공유한다.   

## 👩‍⚖️ 규칙  

1. 글의 종류는 잘 정리된 기사나 블로그 글, 책도 가능하며 너무 읽기가 싫다면 챌린지를 위해서 유튜브 영상이라도 시청하고 후기를 남긴다. 
2. 하루에 하나의 글이 원칙이지만 그 이상도 원하면 얼마든지 올린다. 
3. 문서 생성은 [markdown](https://gist.github.com/ihoneymon/652be052a0727ad59601)을 사용한다.   
    - 후기의 길이는 전혀 상관없으며 양식은 자유다.  
    - **❗단, 읽은 글의 링크는 꼭 남긴다. (링크가 없는 책의 경우 제외)** 
4. 카테고리로 폴더를 만든다. `.md`파일을 해당되는 카테고리 폴더에 넣는다.   
    - 카테고리는 개발 분야 외의 흥미가 가지는 것은 무엇이든지 가능하다.
